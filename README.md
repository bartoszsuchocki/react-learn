# react-learn
Repo for learning react where I will place my simple react projects created only for educational purposes.
## charity app
There is one project representing charity web app where users can find charity organizations and become volunteers. Organizations can share their actions to recruit new people.
App is currently available only in mobile version and is just a front-end stub - it enables user to navigate between screens (all in single page app, so navigating between tabs is very fast and comfy - react router used for that) and see appropriate forms and screens. It probably won't be developed anymore as it is rather simple use case of react application and it was created for learning purposes.

### Used technologies/tools
* Javascript
* React.js
* HTML, CSS, SCSS
